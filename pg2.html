	<h1>Chicago Everyday Life</h1>

	<img src="vintage.jpg" alt="DJ Steele"/>

		<p>Life in Chicago is nothing short of beautiful, the diversity and freedom that everyone carries about themselves is pretty amazing as well. I lived in michigan before here, Battle Creek more specifically. The smell of endless forrest hills and the mist of the river are dearly missed. There are a lot of things I personally didnt think i would miss, looking up and seeing all the stars, waking up to the sound of baby birds outside my window, petting the wild coons. Just the more reason to not take anything for granted, i am going to live my life to the fullest while im out here, and so far i have proven just that.</p>
